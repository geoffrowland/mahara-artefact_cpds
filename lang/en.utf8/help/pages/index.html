<h3>CPD</h3>
<p>Many programmes of study, careers and professions have the expectation, or obligation, of Continuing Professional Development (CPD).</p>
<p>The Mahara CPD allows you to maintain a simple log of your Continuing Professional Development activities. It allows recording of the start date, end date (if appropriate), title, location (physical or virtual) and description of the CPD activity together with the time spent (hours). Also, a rolling total of time spent on CPD is calculated.</p>
<p>Multiple CPD logs may be created. So, you could create a new one for each academic year or for a particular programme of study.</p>
<p>You could add a CPD log to a Portfolio Page together with relevant resources and artefacts. For example: reflective journals, notes, mind maps, presentations, links, images, multimedia clips, digital certificates and badges.</p>
<p>You could share these CPD containing Pages with colleagues, tutors, line-managers etc.</p>
